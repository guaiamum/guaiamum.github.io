#  About this little project:
This is my way of saying who I am and where I've been, along with my experiences in the academic world.
I've designed all the HTML / CSS / JavaScript in this page, may have gotten some ideas and snippets from good'ol Google, won't lie, but this is mainly all my own creation. Enjoy :)
